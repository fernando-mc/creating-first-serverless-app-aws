# Demo Introduction

In this workshop, we'll be building out Serverless Jams - a website dedicated to voting on some of the best coding music out there. Here's a screenshot:

I'll provide a pre-built website using some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you will integrate with several HTTP APIs. You'll also learn how to deploy the service and see it live and hosted on AWS.
