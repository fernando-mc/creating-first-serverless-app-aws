## Introduction

This workshop will show you how to build your first fullstack serverless application using Amazon Web Services. You will look at all the tools and services required to create a web app using AWS services that don't require you to manage server infrastructure. 

If you've never heard of "Serverless" before I'll explain the benefits and drawbacks of moving the responsibility for the configuration and maintenance of servers to a provider like AWS. This workshop will have you working with several AWS services including: Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and AWS API Gateway to create your first fullstack Serverless Application.
